My university project : An implementation of Sparse Matrix in C++.

A Sparse Matrix class which can create matrixes using a 2Dim array and supports adding , multiplying , calculating Transpose using two differnt method.
Also Prints the matrix in a nice table.

This Project was written on November 2013 in Visual C++ 2012 , recompiled in Visual C++ 2015 before uploading to github. It also is expected to compile using g++
